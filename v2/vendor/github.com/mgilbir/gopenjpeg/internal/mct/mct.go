// Package mct implements the multi-component transforms of OpenJPEG:
// the reversible color transform (RCT), the irreversible color transform
// (ICT), and the arbitrary custom MCT matrix path. It is a faithful port of
// mct.c and invert.c from the OpenJPEG (JPEG 2000) reference implementation.
//
// Arithmetic is matched exactly to the C reference: the reversible path uses
// int32 integer arithmetic, the encode-real path uses int32 fixed-point via
// opj_int_fix_mul for the custom matrix and float32 for the RGB ICT, and the
// decode-real path uses float32 with the exact constant order-of-operations.
//
// FMA barriers: Go's spec lets the compiler contract `x*y + z` (and the
// `x*y - z` / `z - x*y` shapes) into a single-rounding FMA, and gc does so on
// arm64/ppc64/s390x/riscv64. The C reference rounds each product separately, so
// every product below that feeds an add or a subtract is wrapped in an explicit
// float32(...)/float64(...) conversion; per the Go spec an explicit
// floating-point conversion rounds to the target type's precision and so
// forbids the fusion. On amd64 gc never fuses, making the conversions a no-op
// there — the byte-identical oracle parity is unchanged. The barriers forbid
// fusion only: operand order and associativity (including the deliberate
// gcc-reassociated grouping documented on EncodeReal/DecodeReal) are untouched.
