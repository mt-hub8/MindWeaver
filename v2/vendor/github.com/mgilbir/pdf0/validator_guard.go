// This file gives every validator the two properties the PDF/A validator has
// had since it was written (audit C27): a panic boundary around each check, so
// a bug or an adversarial structure in one rule cannot crash the caller, and a
// deterministic output order, so reports are stable and diffable.
//
// The PDF/A twins are runCheck / runByteCheck in pdfa.go; the helpers here are
// the same idea adapted to the other validators' finding types and to the
// `add(rule, msg, obj)` reporting style they share.

// internalRule is the rule (or clause) identifier a validator reports when one
// of its own checks panicked. It marks a finding as "the validator broke", not
// "the file is non-conforming", so a caller can tell the two apart.

// of letting it crash the caller. The validators process untrusted files, so a

// process — the rationale runCheck records for PDF/A.
//
// Findings the check already reported before panicking are kept: add appends to

// documented spelling for that distinction. The prefix exists to keep two rule
// *namespaces* from colliding, and these two identifiers belong to neither.

// objects it reaches — reported a different object number each time the same
// file was validated. Ascending object number is a total order, so it does not.

// randomised on every run. Keeping whichever candidate the range happened to
// yield first therefore named a different object each time the same file was
// validated. Keeping the numerically smallest object number instead is a total
// order over the candidates, so the report is reproducible. The choice is
// load-bearing, not incidental: reports are diffed run against run.

// adoptInvoiceFindings replays the findings of a formalis Report through an
// adopt callback, so ValidateFacturX and ValidateOrderX can carry them in their
// own finding type alongside the container findings they made themselves.
//
// Unlike the PDF/A-3 findings adoptPDFAFindings folds in, these keep their rule
// identifiers verbatim, with no namespace prefix. There is nothing to
// disambiguate: formalis mints its identifiers in its own space (EN 16931's
// BR-*, Order-X's ORDER-*, and the reserved "limit", "profile" and "root"),
// pdf0's container identifiers are "structure", "attachment", "metadata" and the
// unreadable-XML rules, and the two sets are disjoint. What a prefix would have
// stood in for — which authority wrote the rule — is carried as data instead, in
// FacturXViolation.Source, where a caller can key on it rather than parse it out
// of a string.
//
// Two consequences of adopting verbatim are the point rather than a side effect:
//
//   - formalis.RuleLimit is "limit", the identifier pdf0 reserves for the same
//     event, so a cancelled or budget-stopped rule engine reaches the caller as a
//     finding IsCheckerFinding recognises, with no special case here. That is the
//     property adoptPDFAFindings has to preserve by hand for the PDF/A-3 half,
//     and the reason both halves must spell it the same way.
//   - formalis.RuleProfile ("profile") is deliberately not folded into that set,
//     although formalis.IsCheckerViolation covers it. It reports that the profile
//     pdf0 passed is not one formalis implements, and pdf0 only ever passes one
//     it read out of the container's XMP — so the finding arises exactly when
//     fx:ConformanceLevel is missing or unrecognised, which is a defect in the
//     document that pdf0 has already reported as a "metadata" finding of its own.
//     It is not a report that pdf0 stopped early, and classifying it as one would
//     hide a real container defect from a caller counting non-conformances.
//
// The advisory flag is what keeps the two halves of the report from being
// conflated. The rule engine reports findings at two severities its authorities
// published — CEN flags 1,168 of the two EN 16931 syntax bindings' assertions
// warning rather than fatal, and a conforming Factur-X EXTENDED invoice trips
// dozens of them by design, since they hold a document down to the EN 16931 core
// subset of CII. Those are not non-conformances and must not land in Violations:
// pdf0's Violation interface carries no severity, so a warning folded into that
// slice would be indistinguishable from a PDF/A-3 failure the moment a caller
// appended it to a mixed report — the reclassification the severity exists to
// prevent, one level up. They are kept, in a field of their own, because
// discarding them would throw away the only reading anyone has of those rules.

// reportCancellation adds the "limit" finding a cancelled container validation
// owes its caller, unless one is already present.
//
// ValidateFacturX and ValidateOrderX compose two rule engines, and each reports
// a cancellation it saw itself: the PDF/A-3 validation through its own limit
// recorder (adopted bare, see adoptPDFAFindings), the invoice rule engine
// through formalis.RuleLimit, which is the same identifier. Neither covers the
// container checks that run between them, and neither runs at all for a
// container with no embedded XML to hand over — so a run cancelled in those
// windows would return findings that read as a verdict on a document nobody
// finished looking at. Polling once on the way out closes them.
