// hybrid electronic invoice. A Factur-X document is a PDF/A-3 file that carries
// a human-readable invoice and an embedded XML representation of the same
// invoice (UN/CEFACT Cross Industry Invoice, EN 16931). This validator checks
// the container — PDF/A-3 conformance, the embedded invoice XML attached as an
// associated file, and the Factur-X XMP metadata that identifies it — and then
// runs the invoice XML through the formalis EN 16931 rule engine at the declared
// profile, mirroring ValidateOrderX. CIUS layers (XRechnung, Peppol, NLCIUS)
// remain the caller's choice, via the returned XML.
//
// The checks are calibrated against a corpus of conforming Factur-X / ZUGFeRD
// invoices across all profiles (MINIMUM, BASIC WL, BASIC, EN 16931, EXTENDED).

// The embedded invoice XML is named factur-x.xml (Factur-X and ZUGFeRD 2.1+);

// values directly, borrowing that type's Object field for PDF object numbers,
// which made Factur-X and Order-X the only findings in this package that could
// not satisfy Violation — the exception the package documentation had to keep

// every other validator's findings and IsCheckerFinding applies to them.

//     CIUS is not a profile and must not be passed as one — that conflation was

//   - neither: res.Profile is passed through empty rather than replaced by a

//     its reserved "profile" rule, so the caller is told the invoice was not
//     checked; substituting EN 16931 would run a rule set the document never
