// Reporting a resource guard that stopped short.
//
// limits.go says what a limit *is* — the defaults, the With* options, the
// resolved limits struct. This file says what happens when one *trips*.
//
// This file gives every resource guard in the package one way to say "I
// stopped short". The package processes untrusted files, so ~70 guards cap the
// work a hostile document can force: work budgets, depth caps, size ceilings,
// hop counters. A guard that trips leaves the checker with an *incomplete*
// picture, and there are only three honest things to do with that:
//
//   - fail loudly (a returned error) — always safe;
//   - decline to assert, and say so — what this file is for;
//   - assert anyway — never safe, and the source of the worst class of bug in
//     a validator: a false positive, where the library accuses a conformant
//     file on the strength of a truncated intermediate result. Audit C46 (a
//     dropped cmap segment made every affected code resolve to "glyph 0", so a
//     good font was reported as referencing .notdef) and the empty-cmap defect
//     found by fuzzing are both exactly this shape.
//
// The rule the codebase now follows is: **a check must never assert a
// violation on the basis of an incomplete result.** When a guard truncates a
// structure, the structure is made self-describing (partial), the consumer
// declines the dependent check, and the trip itself is reported here — under
// its own rule identifier, so a caller can tell "pdf0 could not finish" apart
// from "this file is non-conforming".
//
// docs/limits.md carries the full per-guard classification.

// limitRule is the rule (clause) identifier carried by every finding that
// reports a resource-guard trip. Like internalRule ("internal", used for a
// recovered panic) it names the *checker*, not the document: "6.2.11.4.1" says
// the file is wrong, "limit" says pdf0 stopped short and therefore cannot say
// whether the file is right.
//
// A cancelled run reports itself here too (limitCanceled). A caller's deadline
// is not a resource guard, but it produces exactly the same event — the checker
// stopped before it had seen everything — and so calls for exactly the same
// honesty. Giving it its own rule identifier would have meant every caller that
// already distinguishes "the file is bad" from "pdf0 could not finish" learning
// a second way to spell the second one. See cancel.go.
const limitRule = "limit"

// IsCheckerFinding reports whether a finding describes a problem in the checker
// rather than a non-conformance of the document. Two rule identifiers are
// reserved for this: "internal" (a check panicked and was recovered) and
// "limit" (a resource guard tripped, so a check could not be completed). A
// caller that wants "is this file conformant?" should treat a checker finding
// as "unknown", not as a failure:
//
//	var real []pdf0.Violation
//	for _, e := range pdf0.ValidatePDFA(doc, pdf0.PDFA2b) {
//		if !pdf0.IsCheckerFinding(e) {
//			real = append(real, e)
//		}
//	}

// Neither kind fires on any file in the veraPDF corpus; both mean the input is
// adversarial or the checker has a bug.

// Guard identifiers. These are stable strings: they appear in the message of a
// "limit" finding, so a caller can key on the specific guard. They are named
// after the constant that bounds the work, not after the rule that was skipped
// — one guard can cost several rules.
// Each is annotated with the limits field that bounds it and the With* option
// that configures it, because every guard that can report a trip is also one a
// caller can move: a trip on a lowered bound is the caller's own configuration
// answering back, and the message says so (see limitBound).
